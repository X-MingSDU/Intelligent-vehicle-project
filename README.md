> Software: Pycharm, Keil5 and Creo5 

### Product introduction

   The multi-function intelligent car can be used to collect road condition data (such as road condition picture, surface temperature, speed and acceleration of the car), and also can be used for the development of automatic driving algorithm.

### **Product features**

- It is equipped with six-axis sensor and controlled by single chip microcomputer, which can collect     information such as gyroscope, speed, acceleration and RPY angle.
- The serial camera and raspberry pie can be used to collect image data.
- Two steering gears are configured, and the position of the camera can realize the rotation of two     degrees of freedom through the single-chip microcomputer control.
-  Bluetooth is configured and controlled by single chip microcomputer, and the driving of the car can be controlled by mobile phone or Python code, such as forward and backward, turning, acceleration and deceleration, changing shooting angle, taking photos, etc

### **Document description**

- The "Creo files" folder is Creo engineering files, and the final model is in the "底盘- view.asm ".
- The "C language codes" folder is the code on the car Stc818k. PWM coding, receiving data from Six-axis. 
- "Python codes" is the Python code running in raspberry pie, concerning taking photos and picture processing.
- "Car_ photo" and "images and videos" folders show the model.
